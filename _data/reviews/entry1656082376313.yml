review: "We have used Ray at BRL solutions for a few jobs now both internal and externally plus some tree work in the garden. An extremely hardworking, trustworthy, professional and genuinely all round nice guy who is very knowledgeable in all building and garden areas. He listened to our ideas and needs carefully and was great with advice and solutions. Highly recommended and will continue to use for our house and garden needs. Thanks Ray!"
