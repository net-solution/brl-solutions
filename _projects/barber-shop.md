description:
  "We built a new brick wall at the front of the property, as well as a new fence and gate. We also built a patio area for the garden,
  integrated with the existing space. Inside we built a custom mantlepiece as well as a brick wall along the barbershop area. This area
  included the custom worktops as shown and varnished flooring with skirting boards."
